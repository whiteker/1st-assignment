the summary about the basic concepts of github.       
Repository means the storehouse,which is called cangku in chinese.       
To develop the features of your repository, fix the bug and do not want to affect other branches,you can use the branch,which can also be merged to the main branch.      
Commit is regarded as a handover,in my opinion,however a snapshot according to the github docs.      
Issue is related to commit,you can use issue to subscribe the change and the prospect of your repository.      
Pull request is a request to put your codes or opinions to the addressee.     
When you star a repository,it means that the repository is in your favor and you want to collect it.      
A fork is a copy of a repository that you manage,and you can fetch updates or submit changes to the original repository.
After a repository is watched,you will fetch all updates as soon as it is pulled request or issued.        
When you are longing to be an ace,you can follow all aces you meet.
